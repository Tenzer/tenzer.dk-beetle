In an attempt on getting a bit of activity back here on my blog, I thought I might as well update a bit on what I've been doing lately.

A few weeks ago I went to the concert venue [Gimle](http://gimle.dk/) in Roskilde in order to watch some concerts, primarily with the Danish live drum and bass band [F.U.K.T](http://fukt.dk/) and electronic artist [Rangleklods](http://rangleklods.com/). I had listened to both artists a fair bit prior to the concert, and the concert was free so it was really a no brainer to go.

I decided to try and take some pictures from the concerts in order to get some more experience in shooting low light photography, so the day of the concert I went out and rented a [Canon EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Standard_and_Medium_Telephoto/EF_50mm_f1.4_USM/) which would fit onto my [Canon EOS 550D (Rebel T2i) camera](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_550D/). I tested out the lens a bit prior to the concerts, and found it to not be that sharp when using the wide open apertures. I have also found reviews of the lens which state the same thing, and suggested stopping down to f/2.8 where it can deliver very sharp images. The lens was however much better for the purpose than any alternative I owned, since it either would have to be my [Canon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/EF-S/EF-S_18-55mm_f3.5-5.6_IS_II/) or the [Canon 100mm f/2.8 USM](http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Macro/EF_100mm_f2.8_Macro_USM/) which would have too much zoom and not a wide enough aperture.

So I went to the concert, and I am very satisfied with the results I got out of it, considering it was my first time doing concert photography in the dark. But you can judge for yourself in the [Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/tenzer/sets/72157627485926578/).

For my next concert set I hope to have gotten my hands on a [Sigma 50mm f/1.4 HSM lens](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/product/50mm-f14-ex-dg-hsm) which should be sharper wide open, which is really what you need for the low light shots, and be better built.
