I have made a new version of the [Zenphoto](http://www.zenphoto.org/) gallery plugin, [Zenphoto Sitemap](/projects/zenphoto-sitemap/), available.

The new version is a rewrite of the plugin, in order to increase speed, decrease load and generally make the code easier to read, hence the version number. I have also included a README file in the package.

The new version can either be fetched from [my project page](/projects/zenphoto-sitemap/), or from the new [GitHub project page](https://github.com/Tenzer/zenphoto-sitemap).

I do have some ideas for ways to further improve the plugin, which can be seen on the project [issue tracker](https://github.com/Tenzer/zenphoto-sitemap/issues), and feel free to report anything you would like to see and of course any bugs you may find.
