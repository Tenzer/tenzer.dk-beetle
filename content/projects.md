Here's a list of open source projects I've made that I think are noteworthy:

* [Clear Site Cache](clear-site-cache/) - A Firefox add-on to clear the cached items for a specific site
* [neutralzone.dk](https://github.com/Tenzer/neutralzone.dk) - The code for [neutralzone.dk](http://neutralzone.dk/), a website to show tweets in realtime from Danish American football teams
* [plugin.video.nfl-teams](https://github.com/Tenzer/plugin.video.nfl-teams) - Plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv/) (former XBMC) to watch videos from the various NFL teams' websites
* [Zenphoto-Sitemap](zenphoto-sitemap/) - Sitemap generator for [Zenphoto](http://www.zenphoto.org/)
