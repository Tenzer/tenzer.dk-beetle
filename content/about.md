Hi, I am Jeppe Toustrup, a systems administrator at heart spiced with some development on the side. I have a soft spot for Solaris-derived distributions and the features they have brought to the world, and have contributed to both [illumos](http://illumos.org/), [OpenIndiana](http://openindiana.org/) and [SmartOS](http://smartos.org/). In the Linux world I prefer [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) for its never outdated packages and big archive of user packages in the [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

When programming I tend to do it in either [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or as [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts. I would like to try out [Go](http://golang.org/) at some point when time permits. I prefer working with smaller utilities and libraries which only does one or two things, and does it well, making it easier to understand than big frameworks which does all kind of magic that is difficult to grasp.

Examples of projects I enjoy working with:

* [Nginx](http://nginx.org/)
* [Redis](http://redis.io/)
* [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/)
* [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/)
