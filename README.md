# Tenzer.dk

This is the source code for my personal website and blog.

In order to build the site do the following:

1. Create a Python virtual environment and switch to it.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Use `beetle render htmlmin sitemap` to render the site, minify the HTML and generate the sitemap.

Tip: `beetle clean` can be used to clean out the the `output` folder.
