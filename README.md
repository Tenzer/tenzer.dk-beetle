# Tenzer.dk

This is the source code for my personal website and blog.

In order to build the site do the following:

1. Create a Python virtual environment and switch to it.
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Use the `beetle render` to render the site, optionally add `htmlmin` to the end in order to minify the resulting HTML files.
